- 👋 Hi, I’m @Melissa-Lindskar
- 👀 I’m interested in Quality Assurance, UX Design, and innovative digital solutions.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced techniques in QA Engineering and Interaction Design/UX Design at Linnéuniversitetet. On a personal level, I am trying to learn spanish on a Duolingo and just started to learn freestyle swimming.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving software testing, user experience improvements, and environmental sustainability initiatives.
- 📫 How to reach me: melissa.tau85@gmail.com & www.linkedin.com/in/melissa-lindskar

- ⚡ Fun fact: In addition to my technical skills, I love dogs! And I'm also an artist and love painting abstract art in my free time.
